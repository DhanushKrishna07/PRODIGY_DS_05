This is task 5 of Prodigy InfoTech | Data Science Domain.

Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

üö¶ Analyzing the Impact of Weather and Traffic Signals on US Traffic Accidents üåßÔ∏è

Exploring the critical factors behind traffic accidents in the US using data analysis and visualization techniques.

Project Highlights:

‚Ä¢Investigated a comprehensive dataset of US traffic accidents.
‚Ä¢Analyzed the impact of weather conditions, timestamps, and traffic signals ‚Ä¢on accident occurrences.
‚Ä¢Visualized accident severity to understand contributing factors.

Steps Involved:

‚Ä¢ Imported essential libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
‚Ä¢ Loaded the dataset containing detailed records of US traffic accidents.
‚Ä¢ Checked for and handled null values, and removed duplicate records.
‚Ä¢ Analyzed the dataset for descriptive statistics to get an overview.
‚Ä¢ Visualized accident distribution by weather conditions using count plots.
‚Ä¢ Analyzed accident distribution by weather timestamps to see temporal   patterns.
‚Ä¢ Visualized accident distribution by the presence of traffic signals.
‚Ä¢ Investigated accident severity and contributing factors through visualizations.

Key Takeaway:

This project leverages data visualization to uncover critical insights into the factors contributing to traffic accidents in the US. By examining the impact of weather conditions, timestamps, traffic signals, and accident severity, this analysis provides valuable information for improving road safety measures and policies.
